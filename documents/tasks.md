The Challenge üßóüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
The challenge consists of 3 sub-tasks that should be completed in order to reach the final product.
Task 1: User-Login Page
Users should only be able to log in with the following credentials:
Username: Blona
Password: ToTheSky

Task 2: PDF Uploader
You are tasked with building a (very basic) website where (a logged-in) user can:
Upload new PDFs
See the PDFs they have previously uploaded
Delete previously uploaded PDFs

Task 3: Text Parser
For each uploaded PDF the content (i.e. text) should be parsed out of the PDF
Parsing should be triggered once a new PDF is uploaded
The plain text belonging to each PDF should be made available to the user (e.g. on a button click next to each PDF, via toggling, etc. - you can be creative!)
Note: You do not need to worry about formatting the parsed text :)
